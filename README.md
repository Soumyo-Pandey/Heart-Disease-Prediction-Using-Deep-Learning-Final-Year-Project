# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-Final-Year-Project

This project is used to predict heart disease with the help of Deep Learning Algorithms(ANN).

In this project, we have used technologies like HTML,CSS and Javascript for building the front end of our web application. In the back end, we have used FLASK, in which we have taken care of all the Deep Learning logic and also render our static HTML files from the server side.

To run this project first run pip install on our console. This command will install all the necessary package that is required to run this project.

After this run python app.py on our console. This command will run this project on the local host of our default web browser.
After Successful Installation of packages we have to run app.py file in the Anaconda prompt of Anaconda Software.
This is a web based application where we can predict heart disease by inserting all the details, browser:-Google Chrome(Required).We have used all the required deep learning algorithms for prediction purpose.
